# AGENTS.md

Instructions for coding agents in this repository. Verified commands only —
run them, don't assume. Each layer's non-obvious gotchas live in its doc
under `docs/` — read it before touching that layer. This file loads into
every session, so high-signal detail belongs in `docs/`: use an existing doc
before adding anything here, create one in `docs/` if none fits; update docs
when you change module boundaries, schema, or reader layers.

## What this project is

Local-first desktop ebook library (bookshelf style). **Rust is the
application/domain language; React/TypeScript is only the presentation
layer; Chromium (via Electron) is the sole desktop web runtime.**

- Business logic in Rust (`domain/`, `services/`), UI logic in TypeScript, SQL
  only in `repository/` — boundaries and process model: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Electron `main`/`preload` are plumbing only; the renderer never sees Node.js.
  The Rust sidecar (`sidecar/`) owns DB, filesystem, scanner, and metadata.
- Reader engines behind single-module seams: only
  `frontend/src/lib/epub/readiumEngine.ts` imports Readium, only
  `frontend/src/lib/pdf/pdfEngine.ts` imports MuPDF; components use the
  format-agnostic `Reader` abstraction (`docs/EPUB.md` / `docs/PDF.md`).
- Do not silently change these architectural conventions.

## Writing for humans

Invoke the `unslop` skill over anything a person will read, before you commit, post, or
send it: commit messages, the PR title and body, README and doc edits, code
comments, and the closing reply. It strips AI tells (em dashes, filler,
hedging, chatbot phrases, puffery, bold-label lists) and replaces fancy
words with plain ones and passive voice with active. Apply it to text you
wrote or changed, not to prose you didn't touch.

## Commands

The live command set is in the justfile — check `just --list` and
`docs/BUILD.md` for what is wired up in this migration phase. Run `just check`
(or at minimum the relevant test layer) before declaring any task complete;
run `just format` if you touched formatting-sensitive code.

```sh
pnpm install          # first thing after cloning
just check            # format+lint+typecheck+unit tests, parallel streams
just dev              # launch the app (Electron + Vite hot reload)
just test-e2e         # real-app desktop E2E, headless on Linux (builds first)
just test             # unit tests, rust + frontend concurrently
just test-rust        # cargo test (service crate)
just test-frontend    # vitest run (CI mode)
just bump X.Y.Z       # apply a release version to all versioned files
just audit            # maturity policies, run this before releases.
pnpm --filter frontend exec vitest run <file-or-pattern>
```

### External knowledge & source research

When repository context alone is insufficient, prefer the most specific source:
**Context7** → current, version-specific library/API docs; **GitHits** →
dependency internals and undocumented runtime behavior; **Firecrawl**
(`firecrawl-search`) → the public web. Cross-check when multiple apply; don't
guess. Full policy: `docs/RESEARCH.md`.

## Working documents

Read the one that fits the task; each is short.

- `docs/STANDARDS.md` — coding standards.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — module boundaries, process model, frontend structure.
- `docs/BUILD.md` — build flavors, dev environment.
- `docs/DATABASE.md` — schema, migrations, FTS5.
- `docs/EPUB.md` / `docs/PDF.md` — reader layer contracts (Readium / MuPDF.js).
- `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` — reader performance budgets/metrics and verification;
  check before touching reader rendering.
- `docs/RESOURCE_LIMITS.md` — parser resource quotas (issue #83), the
  `ResourceLimits` table every EPUB/PDF parse path enforces.
- `docs/TESTING.md` — test layers, agent rules, and E2E infrastructure.
- `docs/COVERAGE.md` — per-category coverage floors and exclusions.
- `docs/RELEASE.md` — packaging and cutting releases.
- `docs/SUPPLY_CHAIN.md` — dependency audits, SBOM, build-script and

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

## Beads Issue Tracker

Use Beads (`bd`) for durable task tracking in repositories that include it. Use the `beads` skill at `.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (project install) or `~/.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (global install) for Beads workflow guidance, then use the `bd` CLI for issue operations.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready                # Find available work
bd show <id>            # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>           # Complete work
bd prime                # Refresh Beads context
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for all task tracking; do not create markdown TODO lists.
- Run `bd prime` when Beads context is missing or stale. Codex 0.129.0+ can load Beads context automatically through native hooks; use `/hooks` to inspect or toggle them.
- Keep persistent project memory in Beads via `bd remember`; do not create ad hoc memory files.

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.
